-- A Mystery in Fiftyville: Log File

-- First looking in crime_scene_reports for the report that took place on July 28, 2020 on Chamberlin Street.
-- This is the only known information so far regarding the CS50 Duck being stolen.
SELECT description FROM crime_scene_reports
WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28
AND street = "Chamberlin Street";

    -- According to the crime_scene_reports query: "Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse.
    -- Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse."

-- Checking interviews that same day
SELECT * FROM interviews WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%courthouse%";

    -- The three witnesses include Ruth, Eugene, and Raymond
    -- Look for security footage from the couthouse parking lot within 10 minutes of the theft, which as we know took place at 10:15am on July 28, 2020.
    -- The theif withdrew money on Fifer Street early that morning
    -- The theif made a phone call for less than a minute as they were leaving the courthouse. They were planning on taking the earliest flight out of Fiftyville the next day.
    -- This plane ticket was to be purchased by the person on the other end of the phone.

-- Looking at earliest flight out of Fiftyville on the 29th to see what information can be aquired.

-- Checking where this flight goes:
SELECT city FROM airports WHERE id = 4;

    -- London! (2) The theif escaped to London.

-- It would appear that ONLY Ernest made phone calls on the day of the crime, one of which 
-- was for less than 60 seconds (matching the interview description from above) to Berthold.
-- This would make Ernest the theif and Berthold the accomplice.
