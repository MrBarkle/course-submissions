[Problem Set 1](#problem-set-1)
===============================

Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you, per the course’s policy on [academic honesty](../../syllabus/#academic-honesty).

The staff conducts random audits of submissions to CS50x. Students found to be in violation of this policy will be removed from the course. Students who have already completed CS50x, if found to be in violation, will have their CS50 Certificate permanently revoked.

GitHub now requires that you use SSH or a personal access token instead of a password to log in, but you can still use `check50` and `submit50`! See [cs50.ly/github](https://cs50.ly/github) for instructions if you haven’t already!

[What to Do](#what-to-do)
-------------------------

Be sure you have completed [Lab 1](../../labs/1/) (both the Hello and Population problems) before beginning this problem set.

1.  [Log into Ed via this link](https://cs50.edx.org/ed) and then reply to [this thread](https://us.edstem.org/courses/176/discussion/13252) to say hello (and, if you’d like, a little about yourself!) to other students and staff. If you don’t yet have an account, you should first sign up for Ed.
2.  Go to [ide.cs50.io](https://ide.cs50.io) and click “Log in” to access your CS50 IDE.
3.  Submit one of:
    *   [this version of Mario](mario/less/) if feeling less comfortable
    *   [this version of Mario](mario/more/) if feeling more comfortable
4.  Submit one of:

[Advice](#advice)
-----------------

*   Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 1](../../weeks/1/)’s source code.
*   If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and

    make hello


is yielding errors, try running

    help50 make hello


instead!
