[Code Sample Portfolio 2022](#title)
===========================

[Introduction](#intro)
------------------------------------

Included are some the most recent project submissions of mine to be used as code samples. These projects were completed by me as part of the requirements for both **CS50** and **CS50AI** in the years 2021-2022. They range from solving very simple to more complex problems using C, Python, SQL, or HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The aforementioned courses are provided online via HarvardX, an online learning initiative by Harvard University through edX. <ins>**For the best representation of what I have learned in these courses I recommend taking a look at CS50's weeks 8-10 problem sets and CS50AI's projects.**</ins> Just as within my resume, proof of my completion of these courses can be found below.

For most projects only the main files with extensions .c or .py etc have been included, that is, those directly created or altered by myself for the project submission. Some supplementary files have been removed for sake of uploading.

[Certificates](#certificates)
----------------------------
*   Professional Certificate, [Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence](https://credentials.edx.org/credentials/250b34d0ceb848d28731e47da33e6209)
    * Certificate for CS50AI: [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/1e3f2689-3c92-4818-a4be-9805fc08ae47)
    * Certificate for CS50: [Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/certificates/5990c94d-4b31-423e-8e79-ea37483ce013)

*To be eligible for a verified certificate from edX, a satisfactory score (at least 70%) must be received on each problem set submitted (as well as a 3/4 or 4/4 on any quizzes). A professional certificate in Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence is attained when both CS50 and CS50AI are completed with passing grades.*
