# Code Sample Portfolio
#### Created by [Brandon Barkle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonbarkle)

## Introduction:


Within this portfolio is a collection of projects that I have created over the past few years including both personal projects and course work problem set submissions.
I recommend taking a look at my [Korean Phrase Clock](https://github.com/brandonbarkle/portfolio/tree/main/Korean%20Phrase%20Clock) project, my [Desktop Applications Organizer](https://github.com/brandonbarkle/portfolio/tree/main/Desktop%20Application%20Organizer), and my CS50 Final Project Submission of an [Electronic Laboratory Notebook](https://github.com/brandonbarkle/portfolio/tree/main/CS50/Week%2010%20Final%20Project/project) for examples of code that were my own ideas and not those covered in course material.
