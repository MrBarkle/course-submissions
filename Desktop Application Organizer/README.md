## Project Description:

I created this project back in 2018 after my retirement from Lotro as an homage to the 10 years I spent as part of a vast community of gamers exploring middle-earth.

This project uses Python's Tkinter toolkit and object-oriented programming to to create a desktop application organizer in the theme of inventory bags found in the MMORPG [The Lord of the Rings Online](https://www.lotro.com/home) (Lotro). Rather than placing icons for files and executables within the desktop environment, this project keeps these items hidden until the 'i' button is pressed, at which point 6 bags with 90 available inventory slots appear containing any items placed within. From inside of a bag the user can hover over an item to reveal a tooltip description of the associated file or program and then click on the accompanying icon to run it.

The project file is saved as a .pyw rather than a .py so that it can mimic an executable without the addition of a terminal window. In this way, the terminal window is suppressed and hidden from view. When in focus, it takes on the following appearance:

Figure 2: Here is what inventory bags looked like as part of the Lotro UI.

Instead of having in game items, I have mimicked the look and feel of inventory bags to be used with computer applications instead.

## Code Coming Soon:

Since the inception of this project I have learned a great deal more about object-oriented programming concepts and Python in general. While I do list this project as experience on my resume, I have opted to upload this README as a placeholder for the time being while I work to re-write my original code into a cleaner final product that I can be proud to show to the open-source community. While the original works great, and I continue to use it to this day, It was a mess of google'd code pieces and poor design that was hardcoded together to work only for me and me alone. I'm in the process of making this project work for anyone so they may also share in the nostalgia!
